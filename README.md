We are working with the library "interact.js".

A lightweight library that enables for easy and interactive drag and dropping.

There is no requirement to install the project with NPM but you can, you can also add a CDN or install the js file and add it in your lib in the project. This is if you are interested in trying it yourself.

If you just want to try our demo:


Download our project on git: https://github.com/marjanadragicevic/apigroup9

Start it up locally and voila; the interact.js file comes in the lib folder making it available for you instantly.

Please visit https://interact.io where you can find the author and more documentation.
